# Cloze as Item Plugin

## Features

- Create clozes that behave like items.
- The item can optionally inherit components like clozes do.
- The item will have a higher starting interval than normal clozes.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/bjsi/SuperMemoAssistant.Plugins.HtmlTables/releases/latest) on this GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest available version.
3. Navigate to the development plugin folder (`C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\Documents\SuperMemoAssistant\Plugins\Development`) and extract the zip folder into the directory.

Note: If you are upgrading from an older version, you should delete the older version first.

## Usage

There is a single command:

1. Cloze as Item (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Z)

Note: You need to manually set hotkeys in the plugin settings page for the commands that you want to use.

### Settings

> You can access the settings of any SuperMemoAssistant plugin by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O and clicking the gear icon.

You can decide whether you want the item elements to inherit components like image components.
